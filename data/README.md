# Population Synthesis Data

Data files required for generating the MATSim demand should be copied to this folder. 

For the JIBE team, the following files are located in the JIBE working group shared folder at `/melbourne/synthetic_population/data`.

```
absRegionsReprojected.sqlite
addresses.csv.gz
distanceMatrix.rds
distanceMatrixIndex.csv
melbourne-2016-population.zip
melbourne-2016-population.zip.dir/
sa1_2016_aust.csv.gz
SA1attributed.csv.gz
SA1centroids.csv.gz
VISTA_12_18_CSV.zip
VISTA_12_18_CSV.zip.dir/
```

This data represents population demographics, activities and trips for Melbourne based on [ABS 2016](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/2016) and [VISTA 2012-2018](https://transport.vic.gov.au/about/data-and-research/vista).

Due to its size this data is stored outside this Git repository.
