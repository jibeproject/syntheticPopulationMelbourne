# Population Synthesis Data

Data files required for generating the MATSim demand should be copied to this folder. 

For the JIBE team, the following files are located in the JIBE working group shared folder at `/melbourne/synthetic_population/data`.

```
absRegionsReprojected.sqlite
addresses.csv.gz
distanceMatrix.rds
distanceMatrixIndex.csv
melbourne-2016-population.zip
sa1_2016_aust.csv.gz
SA1attributed.csv.gz
SA1centroids.csv.gz
VISTA_12_18_CSV.zip
```

This data represents population demographics, activities and trips for Melbourne based on [ABS 2016](https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/2016) and [VISTA 2012-2018](https://transport.vic.gov.au/about/data-and-research/vista).

The zipped folders should be extracted.

Due to its size this data is stored outside this Git repository.
